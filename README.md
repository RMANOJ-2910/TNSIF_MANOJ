# ðŸ’» Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) Concepts in Java

This project demonstrates the core *Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)* principles using *Java*.  
It includes clear examples of *Class, Object, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation, and Abstraction*, which form the foundation of modern Java programming.

---

## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview

The goal of this project is to explain and implement *OOPs concepts* practically through Java programs.  
Each concept is illustrated using simple, real-world examples for better understanding.

## ðŸ§© OOPs Concepts Covered

1. *Class and Object* â€“ Defines reusable structures and real-world entities.  
2. *Encapsulation* â€“ Restricts direct access to internal data using getters and setters.  
3. *Inheritance* â€“ Enables reusability by deriving classes from existing ones.  
4. *Polymorphism* â€“ Allows a single function or method to behave differently based on the object.  
5. *Abstraction* â€“ Hides complex implementation details and exposes only necessary features.
